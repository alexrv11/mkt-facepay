// Bundle code depending on the type of viewport

// Examples:
//   1) If $context is set to 'responsive' (default value),
//      the bundle will include the shared styles, mobile mods,
//      and desktop mods (the latest scoped in a media query).
//   2) If $context is set to 'mobile', the bundle
//      will include shared styles plus its mobile mods.
//   3) If $context is set to 'desktop', the bundle
//      will include shared styles plus its desktop mods.
